Benjamin Shelton Kirk was born in Durham, North Carolina on January 26, 1978.  During his career as a graduate student, Ben was a Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellow. Research interests include parallel finite element computations, and the development of object-oriented scientific software in \cpp. He is an active developer for the \texttt{libmesh}\footnote{\texttt{http://libmesh.sourceforge.net}} open source finite element library, and an application code built over this library was used to obtain the numerical results in this dissertation. He also has a long-term interest in a research or teaching position in academia.

Ben joined the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Lyndon B.\ Johnson Space Center in the wake of the \emph{Columbia} tragedy and has subsequently been involved in Space Shuttle Return to Flight, Space Shuttle mission support since STS-114, and is currently leading NASA's analysis efforts in developing the aerothermodynamic design environment for the Project Orion Crew Module.
