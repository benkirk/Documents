\section{Radial Spots Behind an Advancing Swarm Ring}
This section presents mesh and time convergence studies performed for the biological application presented in Section~\ref{sect:swarm_ring}.  The goal of these studies was (b) to produce high-accuracy reference solutions and (b) to determine the time accuracy required for the system.  These solutions are used for comparison to validate the adaptive algorithm.

The region of interest is a $[-10,10]^2$ subdomain.  Mesh convergence is obtained for the $200\times 200$ mesh.}

The region of interest is a $[-10,10]^2$ subdomain.  Essentially all cases are time converged.}
