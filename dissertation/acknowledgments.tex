I would like to thank my advisor, \mbox{Dr.\ Graham F.\ Carey}, for his continued support and advice.  I also wish to thank all of my colleagues in the CFDLab, most notably John Peterson, Dr.\ Bill Barth, and Dr.\ Michael Anderson, for many useful discussions at the white board.  I am also grateful to the U.S.\ Department of Energy as this work was made possible in part by the Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship.  I also thank my current employer, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, for providing me the freedom and flexibility to complete this work.

Mr.\ Joseph Coblish of the Arnold Engineering Development Center in White Oaks, Maryland provided much of the validation data used in the transient double-cone simulations presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:compressible}. Mr.\ Randolph Lillard of the NASA Lyndon B.\ Johnson Space Center aided this work by suggesting other high-quality hypersonic aero\-thermodynamic experimental data which were instrumental in validating the finite element formulation used in this work.  Finally, my wife Shanee deserves thanks for her never-ending support in what surely seemed like a never-ending process.
